The project consists of 2 main parts:
  - The filled notebook of the GloVe part of the lab
  - The answers to the FastText part of the lab

Our implementiation consists of two files, `GloVe.ipynb` and `FastText.ipynb`. The first one correspond to the `fill_your_own_glove.ipynb` filled by us and the second one correspond to the answers about FastText library.

It uses the following libraries:
  - `datasets` for the dataset
  - `PyTorch` for the training and testing of a classifier in the GloVe part
  - `TorchText` for the vocabulary and GloVe implementation
  - `FastText` for the training and testing of a classifier in the FastText part
